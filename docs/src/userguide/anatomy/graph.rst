Graph
=====

In **streaming** mode, Klio makes use of `Google Pub/Sub`_ and `GCS buckets`_ to create a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to string job dependencies together, allowing various modes of execution.

Klio support two modes of execution: :ref:`top-down <top-down>` and :ref:`bottom-up <bottom-up>`.

.. _top-down:

Top-Down Execution
------------------

With top-down execution, every Klio job in the graph is run for every file submitted to it.

Here we have a graph of Klio jobs. A Pub/Sub message containing a :ref:`kliomessage` (which in it
contains a reference to a unique file) is published to the left-most job (the "apex" job). That
job runs the necessary logic on the referenced file. Once it's done, it publishes a ``KlioMessage``
to Pub/Sub for the child jobs to consume. Once those child jobs finish, they publish a
``KlioMessage`` to Pub/Sub for their child jobs to consume, and so on.

This continues until all jobs in a graph have been executed for a particular audio file.

.. note::

    Any job can be an "apex" node!

    While the above animation shows a message being published to the root of the overall graph,
    you may publish messages to any job directly. Depending on the execution mode of the published
    message (top-down or bottom-up), any job downstream of the originally-triggered job may
    (top-down) or may not (bottom-up) be triggered.

.. _bottom-up:

Bottom-Up Execution
-------------------

It's not always efficent or necessary to run every Klio job in the graph for a given file. Maybe
you just want to run a single job for a file, which sometimes means running the parent Klio jobs
to fill in missing dependencies.

In bottom-up execution mode, missing dependencies for a particular job are recursively created.

Here we have another graph of Klio jobs, and we publish a Pub/Sub message (a reference to a file)
to our Klio job, the right-most node here.

Klio will first check to see if the input file for that file is available to download. If it sees
that it's missing, Klio will submit a :ref:`kliomessage` to Pub/Sub of the same file reference to
the parent job that generates the input file. If the input to that job is _also_ missing, Klio
will submit the same Pub/Sub message to _its_ parent.

When the parent job finishes, it essentially resubmits work to child jobs. But Klio is smart
enough to not let it trigger _all_ child jobs â€“ only the jobs that are in the direct path of the
originating job is triggered. Other child jobs won't do any unnecessary work.

Bottom-up execution is particularly useful whenever work needs to be re-run in just one part of
the graph.
