What is Klio?
-------------

.. start-intro

Klio is an :violetemph:`ecosystem` that allows you to process audio files – or any binary files – easily and at scale.

Klio jobs are :violetemph:`opinionated` data pipelines in Python (streaming or batch) built upon `Apache Beam <https://beam.apache.org/>`_ and tuned for audio and binary file processing.

Klio was built by Spotify to run our large-scale :violetemph:`audio intelligence systems` and is used by teams of engineers and audio researchers to help develop and deploy next generation audio algorithms.
